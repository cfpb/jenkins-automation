 Welcome to jenkins-automation  ![](https://travis-ci.org/imuchnik/jenkins-automation.svg?branch=master)
==================

Repos automated by Jenkins DSL 

Jenkins automation is a library of helper functions to make continuous integration and deplypment fast,  easy and fun. 

We use [Job DSL](https://github.com/jenkinsci/job-dsl-plugin/wiki) to automate.
We have further enhanced the functionality with a set of builders. You can see what they can do and how to use them in our 
[API documentation] (http://cfpb.github.io/jenkins-automation/)

Our collection of builders is still growing and we would love your contributions. Please see [How to contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md)

### Good place to start learning about job-dsl API:
    
    http://jenkinsci.github.io/job-dsl-plugin/
  
### Once you are little more comfortable, try the sandbox:
  
    http://job-dsl.herokuapp.com/
  
#### If you would like to get started on it for your project a good place to start is our
[starter repo](https://github.com/cfpb/jenkins-as-code-starter-project). 

## Guiding principles

1. Make valuable
